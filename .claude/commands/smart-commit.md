description: Analyze git changes and organize into logically grouped Conventional Commits, or amend an existing commit message
argument: Optional commit hash to amend (e.g. d0551b2a8b073e57acd7abd6167d23834ab8996d)
---

## Mode detection

If a commit hash argument is provided → go to **Amend mode**.
Otherwise → go to **Create mode**.

---

## CRITICAL: Commit attribution

**NEVER add any of the following to commit messages:**

- `Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>`
- `Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>` or any other model variant
- `🤖 Generated with Claude Code`
- Any mention of Claude, Anthropic, AI assistants, or LLMs in trailers

When running `git commit` or `git commit --amend`, pass ONLY the header and (optionally) the body. Do not append an extra `-m` with a co-author trailer. The commit must look as if a developer wrote it manually.

---

## Commit message rules (apply to BOTH modes)

Messages follow [Conventional Commits 1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

Format:

```
<type>[optional scope][!]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Type

Required. One of:

| Type       | Use for                                                            |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `feat`     | A new feature                                                       |
| `fix`      | A bug fix                                                           |
| `docs`     | Documentation only                                                  |
| `style`    | Formatting, whitespace, semicolons — no behaviour change            |
| `refactor` | Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature             |
| `perf`     | Performance improvement                                             |
| `test`     | Adding or correcting tests                                          |
| `build`    | Build system, bundler config, or dependencies                       |
| `ci`       | CI configuration and scripts                                        |
| `chore`    | Housekeeping that doesn't touch `src/` or tests                     |
| `revert`   | Reverts a previous commit                                           |

This repository's history contains a `deps:` prefix (`818ff23 deps: add react-i18next and i18next`). That is not a Conventional Commits type — use `build(deps):` for dependency changes going forward. Do not reuse `deps:`.

### Scope

Optional. A noun in parentheses naming the affected area, lowercase: `feat(i18n):`, `fix(projects):`.

Scopes that fit this repository: `i18n`, `projects`, `header`, `about`, `experience`, `knowledge`, `routing`, `deploy`, `deps`, `ui`, `const`.

Use a scope when it narrows the change usefully. Omit it when the change is repo-wide or the type alone is clear.

### Description

- Lowercase first letter, unless it starts with a proper noun or identifier (`fix: Vite base path…`)
- Imperative, present tense: `add`, `fix`, `remove` — NOT `added`, `adds`, `adding`
- No trailing period
- Header (type + scope + description) stays within 72 characters
- Says what the change does, specifically — not `update stuff`, not `various fixes`

### Breaking changes

Mark with `!` before the colon, a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer, or both:

```
feat(i18n)!: switch translation keys from indices to slugs

BREAKING CHANGE: project entries in const.ts must be re-keyed; the
numeric `projects.N.title` keys no longer resolve.
```

### Body

Optional. Add it only when the header alone is not self-explanatory.

- Separated from the header by one blank line
- Explains **what** changed and **why**, not how — the diff shows how
- Wrapped at ~72 characters; bullet points are fine
- Plain sentences, no `TYPE:` prefixes repeated inside

### Footers

Optional, after a blank line following the body: `BREAKING CHANGE: <description>`, `Refs: #123`, `Reverts: <hash>`. Never an AI attribution trailer (see above).

### Examples

```
feat(i18n): add RU/EN language switcher to header
```

```
fix(i18n): remove duplicate projects key from translation files

Both locale files declared "projects" twice at the top level — once as
an object with title/description/backToMain, once as an array of project
entries. JSON.parse kept the last, so t('projects.title') rendered the
raw key. The array now lives under projectsList and const.ts key strings
point at it.
```

```
refactor(knowledge): move hardcoded education and language strings to i18n
```

```
build(deps): add react-i18next and i18next
```

```
fix(routing): keep the /cv base path in sync across vite, router and 404
```

```
docs: describe the GitHub Pages redirect hack in CLAUDE.md
```

Wrong:

- `Added language switcher` — past tense, capitalised, no type
- `feat: Add language switcher.` — capitalised description, trailing period
- `FEAT: add language switcher` — type must be lowercase
- `fix: update stuff` — says nothing about what changed
- `deps: add i18next` — `deps` is not a valid type; use `build(deps):`
- `feat(i18n): translation` — noun instead of an imperative verb
- `fix: исправлена отправка писем` — English only

## Amend mode

### 1. Read the existing commit

Run:

```
git log -1 --format="%B" <COMMIT_HASH>
```

### 2. Analyze the current message

Check the existing header and body against the commit message rules above. Identify what needs to change:

- Wrong, missing, or non-conventional type (`deps:`, `TYPE:`, no type at all)?
- Description not lowercase imperative, or ending in a period?
- Header over 72 characters?
- Scope missing where it would help, or wrong?
- A breaking change not marked with `!` or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer?
- Body bullets violating the rules?

### 3. Also read the diff to understand the actual changes

```
git show --stat <COMMIT_HASH>
git show <COMMIT_HASH>
```

### 4. Present the amended message

```
Current message:
<current message as-is>

Proposed message:
<type>(<scope>): <description>

<body line 1>
<body line 2>

Files: file1.ts, file2.tsx

Continue? [y/n]
```

Wait for the user to confirm. If the user says `n` or requests changes, adjust and show again.

### 5. Execute the amend

If the commit is the latest (HEAD):

```
git commit --amend -m "<type>(<scope>): <description>" -m "<body>"
```

If the commit is NOT HEAD, use interactive rebase:

```
GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR="sed -i 's/^pick <SHORT_HASH>/reword <SHORT_HASH>/'" git rebase -i <COMMIT_HASH>~1
```

Then when the editor opens, apply the new message.

**Reminder:** do not add `Co-Authored-By` or any AI trailer to `--amend`.

---

## Create mode

### 1. Gather all changes

Run the following to get a full picture:

```
git status
git diff HEAD
git diff --cached
```

### 2. Analyze semantic intent

Read every changed file's diff carefully. For each change ask:

- What feature, fix, or refactor does this serve?
- Is this change coupled to another file's change (they must go together), or is it independent?
- Would splitting produce a more meaningful git history — or just noise?

Grouping rules:

- Changes to the same component, page, or module → likely one commit
- A UI change plus the state or data it reads → one commit
- An unrelated bugfix alongside a feature → separate commits
- Localization key additions → group with the primary feature they serve, unless they span many unrelated features (then a `chore` or `docs` commit of their own)
- Dependency additions that a feature needs → `build(deps):`, separate from the feature commit
- Do NOT group by file type or technical layer (e.g. don't put all `.ts` files together just because they're `.ts`)

One commit per type: a group that would need two types in its header is really two commits.

If all changes logically belong together — make one commit. Never split artificially.

### 3. Present the commit plan

Before touching anything, output the full plan in this format:

```
Proposed commits (N):

[1] fix(i18n): remove duplicate projects key from translation files

Both locale files declared "projects" twice at the top level, so the
array shadowed the object and t('projects.title') rendered the raw key.

Files: public/locales/en/translation.json, public/locales/ru/translation.json, src/const.ts

[2] refactor(knowledge): move education and language strings to i18n

Files: src/components/knowledge.tsx, public/locales/en/translation.json

Continue? [y/n]
```

Wait for the user to confirm before proceeding. If the user says `n` or requests changes, adjust the plan accordingly and show it again.

### 4. Execute commits

Commit on the current branch. Never create or switch branches, and never suggest doing so — this is a single-developer repository that works directly on `main`.

For each group in order:

1. Stage only the relevant files: `git add <file1> <file2> ...`
2. Commit with the generated message including body:

```
git commit -m "<type>(<scope>): <description>" -m "<body>"
```

**Reminder:** do not add `Co-Authored-By: Claude` or any AI trailer. Pass only `-m` with the header and (optionally) `-m` with the body.
